# Vitag-NFC-Based-Campus-Payment-App
Vitag is an NFC-powered mobile payment application designed to simplify and digitize campus transactions for students and vendors. Integrated with the universe wallet already provided in the student login portal, Vitag enables offline peer-to-merchant payments using NFC technologyâ€”especially useful in areas with poor or no internet connectivity.
